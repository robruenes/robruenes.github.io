<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">What are the URI's for the files you have published?</li>
<li class="a">
<!-- Update the following by inluding the absolute URI in both the href and text -->
Web page is at: <a href="http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~rruene01/html_proj/mypage.html">http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~rruene01/html_proj/mypage.html</a>
<br>
Stylesheet is at: <a href="http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~rruene01/html_proj/stylesheet.css">http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~rruene01/html_proj/stylesheet.css</a>

</li>

<li class="q">How much HTML and CSS did you already know before starting this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I knew a little bit about HTML and CSS before this assignment. I vaguely knew how to write in both, how to select elements with CSS, etc. but I'd never had to actually 
make a page from scratch before and didn't know many of the tags associated with writing in HTML.
</li>

<li class="q">What (non-obvious) HTML features did you learn for this assignment (a simple list is fine, but include more detailed comments if you like):</li>
<li class="a">I learned about:
<ul>
<li>Linking to a specific part of a page using IDs. I've encountered this in my experience with the web but I didn't know how it was done in HTML.</li>
<li>Although I knew that tags in HTML could be assigned classes, I was unaware that they could be assigned individual IDs as well.</li>
<li>I was unfamiliar with the use of spans in HTML. Now I realize having the ability to use them for text selection via IDs can be a useful feature.</li>
</ul>
<!-- you can replace this comment with more text if you like -->
</li>

<li class="q">Explain briefly the difference between a &lt;div> and a &lt;span></li>
<li class="a">
The div tag is an HTML's block level elements, and will introduce a line break with its use. It appears to me that divs are utilized for creating logical
divisions within the content of a webpage. Meanwhile, span tags can be utilized for targeting inline elements.
</li>

<li class="q">What help did you receive from others? (You don't have to
indicate if someone just told you in general about an interesting HTML or CSS feature, or if they gave general
ideas for making your Web page(s) more interesting, but
you must identify any help you received with learning how to write or debug your code.)</li>
<li class="a">
I didn't really utilize help from anyone aside from utilizing the web to look up different HTML and CSS features.
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should know about grading your work (e.g. links we need to follow to see more)?</li>
<li class="a">
Nope.
</li>


<li class="q">Did you do any work for <a href="htmlassignment#extracredit">extra credit</a>?</li>
<li class="a">
Nope.
</li>


<li class="q">(will not be graded) Do you have any questions about learning HTML? Anything you'd like to see covered more carefully in class?:</li>
<li class="a">
No.
