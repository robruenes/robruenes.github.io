		<h2>Personal Experience</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>I began fencing my freshman year at <span id="centereach">Centereach High School</span> in Centereach, New York, where I grew up. 
	   Although the sport is not found in many high schools around the country, the tri-state area
	   flourished as a hub for this sport back in the 80s, and a strong fencing community still exists
	   on Long Island today - Rocky Point's Mission Fencing Center is the largest club in the country and has served
	   as a practice space for countless world class fencers. </p>

	 <p>Most of my friends had older siblings who were captains on the team when I was a freshman, and as such
	 we felt compelled to join. I fenced epee for three years, and fenced foil my senior year to make up for
	 a newly emptied spot in the varsity squad that needed to be filled in. Since my matriculation at Tufts,
	 I've returned to fencing epee, and am now captain of the <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/mensfencing/">Tufts Men's Fencing Team</a>.
	 </p>

	<p>The Tufts Men's Fencing Team primarily competes in the Spring semester, although we hold practices three times a week
	during the Fall semester and attend "The Big One" at Smith College every November. Unlike our meets and tournaments in the Spring,
	"The Big One" is an individual's event, so it's every man for himself. In the Spring we fence both nearby club and varsity teams,
	facing strong competition from schools like MIT, Dartmouth, and Boston College. In April we attend Club Nationals, where we fence
	an even wider selection of teams. This year's Club Nationals is going to be held in Knoxville, Tennesee.

	 	<h2>How does fencing work?</h2>
	 </div>
	 <p>Although one of the oldest olympic sports, many people do not know the rules of fencing. There are three different weapons (descibed in the <a href="#weapontable">table</a> below),
	 	but some factors are common to all three:</p>
	 		<ul>
	 			<li>Bouts take place on a strip/piste, which is between 1.5 and 2 meters wide, and is 14 meters long.</li>
	 			<li>The en garde lines are two meters in each direction from the midpoint.</li>
	 			<li>Warning lines exist two meters from the end of the strip in both directions.</li>
	 			<li>If a fencer crosses the end of the strip, their opponent receives a touch.</li>
	 			<li>The typical bout lasts to 5 touches.</li>
	 		</ul>
