Personal Webpage
================

This is my personal webpage for Ming Chow's Web Programming class at Tufts University, Fall 2014.

The three html pages with css stylings have been implemented correctly.
I have not discussed this assignment with anyone.
The total time spent on this project was 2 hours.

The Tufts CS address that redirects to the page hosted on GitHub is http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~rruene01/twentyhome/index.html. I already have a personal site hosted at the Tufts CS URL and did not want to replace it with this homepage.
