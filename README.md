Personal Webpage
================

This is my personal webpage for Ming Chow's Web Programming class at Tufts University, Fall 2014.

The three html pages with css stylings have been implemented correctly.
I have not discussed this assignment with anyone.
The current time devoted to this project has been 1.5 hours.
