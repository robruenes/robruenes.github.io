        I joined Google's NYC office in 2015 on a 12 person team that became the
        foundation for our 100+ engineer News org. In the time since, I've:

      <ul>
        <li>

        <li>Worked primarily in Java and Spring</li>

      I continued part time during my final semester at Tufts:
      <ul>
        <li>Making further improvements to the test suite</li>

        Summer 2013 was spent at MIT Lincoln Lab in Lexington, MA, contributing
        to a big data project centered around the visualization of geospatial
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identified and integrated an
          <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/"
            >open source geospatial dataset</a
          >
          that could be viewed by the tool, with the goal of the team publishing
          a paper about our software.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Wrote Python scripts to periodically check GDELT's site for new
              raw data files and download them for ingestion
            </li>
            <li>
              Built MapReduce pipeline to transform the data into a form
              suitable for viewing in the tool
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Built new visualization capabilities into the tool using D3.js and

        I attended
        <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/">Tufts' School of Arts and Sciences</a>
        as a student from September 2011 to December 2014, when I graduated
        Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stayed on campus throughout the spring working as a Graduate TA,
        because moving alone to NYC sounded much less fun than a final semester
        with no coursework ðŸ˜‚
      </p>

      <p>A few professors who left a real lasting impression on me:</p>
      <ul id="prof-list">
        <li>
          <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/remco-chang"
            >Remco Chang</a
          >, whose Intro to CS course likely saved me from a version of the
          present where I'd be attending med school at this moment. Later on, I
          worked in Remco's
          <a href="http://valt.cs.tufts.edu/">Visual Analytics Lab @ Tufts </a>,
          and asked him to be my undergrad advisor (which couldn't have gone
          better - "I'll tell you which of them are really bad lecturers, just
          close the door so they can't hear me.")
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/ming-chow"
            >Ming Chow</a
          >, who is easily the most energetic professor I've ever had and who
          had endless amounts of practical, valuable advice for students looking
          to join the software industry. Ming, if you're reading this, sorry
          that my Github is looking so sparse! ðŸ˜…
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/noah-mendelsohn"
            >Noah Mendelsohn</a
          >, whose Internet-Scale Distributed Systems course was easily one of
          my favorite courses during undergrad. Noah broke down enormous
          systems, walking through the tradeoffs for each possible design at
          every layer. This turned out to be enormously useful for my current
          work, so thank you Noah!

        While at Tufts, I also fenced epee on the

          >Men's Club Fencing Team</a
        >, and was epee captain my junior and senior year.
