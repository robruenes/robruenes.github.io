      <p>
        In 2015 I started working in Google's NYC office on a small team that
        served as the foundation for the company's News org. I'm
        interested in reducing unnecessary complexity in large systems, and
        even more interested in building equitable and inclusive environments
        where workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a bit more detail about my work.
      </p>
      <ul id="top-list">
        <li>I've acted as a technical leader within my immediate team and in the broader
          organization.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I've led projects with 30+ contributors, like
              the latest version of <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=Joe%20Biden&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen">
              Search in Google News</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consistently delivered on high-stakes projects, including
              surfacing COVID-19 news to Search users during the global
              pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've worked diligently to reduce technical complexity across
              our systems. This includes acting as a thoughtful partner to 
              infrastructure teams, dogfooding new offerings and providing
              course-correcting feedback. In this capacity, I provided
              significant design guidance for Search's current overall
              feature rendering architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've made significant independent contributions throughout
              the stack, ranging from interactive feature development
              on the client (HTML5/CSS3/ES6) to backend server development
              improving our understanding of user queries (C++/Java).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I've developed expertise in data-driven decision making during 
          the product development lifecycle.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I frequently design, conduct and analyze dozens of quantitative
              feature A/B tests, using custom tooling in addition to SQL and 
              Google Colab.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've also conducted several qualitative user surveys to aid in 
              product development.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I care deeply about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and have
          taken a strong interest in mentorship, team culture, and making
          Alphabet a better and safer place to work, especially for those 
          who belong to historically marginalized groups.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I organized <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org">AWU-CWA</a>
              with my coworkers in the year prior to our 
              <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html">
              public launch</a>, and served as the NYC chapter's elected chapter coordinator
              throughout 2021.
            </li>
            <li>
              I volunteered with Google's now-retired Engineering Residency
              program. Over the years I hosted 5 engineers who converted to
              full time employment after their residency, and both facilitated
              and spoke on 7 internal career panels.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've mentored 5 summer interns.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm a member of the News org's team culture working group, working
              to make our org the best place to work inside of Google.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I've been lucky to work on products used by millions of people across the
        world, but I'm luckier to work alongside a brilliant team that I get to 
        learn from every day.

        I spent Summer 2014 as an intern at Galatea Associates in Somerville,
        MA. While there I:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed an integration testing suite for a stock position keeping

        <li>Worked primarily in Java and Spring</li>

      I continued part time during my final semester at Tufts:
      <ul>
        <li>Making further improvements to the test suite</li>
        <li>

        Summer 2013 was spent at MIT Lincoln Lab in Lexington, MA, contributing
        to a big data project centered around the visualization of geospatial
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identified and integrated an
          <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/"
            >open source geospatial dataset</a
          >
          that could be viewed by the tool, with the goal of the team publishing
          a paper about our software.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Wrote Python scripts to periodically check GDELT's site for new
              raw data files and download them for ingestion
            </li>
            <li>
              Built MapReduce pipeline to transform the data into a form
              suitable for viewing in the tool
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Built new visualization capabilities into the tool using D3.js and

      <p>
        I attended
        <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/">Tufts' School of Arts and Sciences</a>
        as a student from September 2011 to December 2014, when I graduated
        summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science. During what would
        have been my eighth semester, I continued living on campus with
        friends and worked as a Graduate TA before moving to NYC to
        start at Google.
      </p>

      <p>A few professors who left a real lasting impression on me:</p>
      <ul id="prof-list">
        <li>
          <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/remco-chang"
            >Remco Chang</a
          >, my Intro to CS course professor and undergrad advisor, who made CS 
          accessible to students like myself who didn't grow up inside of a Debian 
          terminal. I later worked in Remco's <a href="http://valt.cs.tufts.edu/">
          Visual Analytics Lab @ Tufts</a>. I'm deeply grateful to him for where
          I am today, and for telling me who all of the bad lecturers were.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/ming-chow"
            >Ming Chow</a
          >, an iconic Tufts CS professor that imparted an unmatched amount
          of practical advice and knowledge to students looking to join the
          industry. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a

            >Noah Mendelsohn</a
          >, who taught my favorite class, Internet-Scale Distributed 
          Systems. This class also holds the honor of being the source of the
          only all-nighter I've ever pulled; it turns out implementing a remote
          file-transfer protocol is something you shouldn't wait until the last
          minute to do.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        While at Tufts, I also fenced epee on the
        <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/mensfencing/index.html"
          >Men's Club Fencing Team</a
        >, and was epee captain my junior and senior year.
