				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I grew up in Centereach, New York, a hamlet in Suffolk County, Long Island, just over an hour east of New York City, living with my wonderful parents, sister, and a number of different dogs over the years. While living on the island, I cultivated strong interests in music, fencing epee, and the sciences. When I wasn't competing or studying, you would probably find me with my friends in one of the city's many music venues.</p>

				<p>I graduated from Centereach High School in 2011, ranked as class Salutatorian and a member of three academic honor societies.
I entered Tufts University that fall, believing that I would study Biology and later attend medical school, until I took Introduction to Computer Science with <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco">Remco Chang</a> (now my advisor), and realized that I wanted to major in CS. Since then, I have both taken and TA'd for numerous computer science courses here at Tufts.</p>

				<p>If I'm not at work in Halligan Hall, you can probably find me in the Jackson Gym, leading the <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/mensfencing/index.html">Tufts Men's Fencing Team</a>'s epee squad as captain, or practicing bass in the late hours of the night, much to the chagrin of my housemates.</p>
