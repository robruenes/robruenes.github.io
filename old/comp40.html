			<h3>Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming</h3>
		
			<p>COMP40 - Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming was taught my sophomore year at Tufts under <a href="http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~msheldon/">Mark Sheldon</a> and  <a href="http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~noah/">Noah Mendelsohn</a>. Listed on this page are descriptions of some of the more exciting projects I completed throughout the course of this class.</p>


			<h3>Image Compressor/Decompressor</h3>
			<p>Written in C. The image compressor utilizes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">discrete cosine transform</a> and is capable of taking a PPM image and writes a file of 32-bit binary words. The decompressor is able to read one of these binary files and reproduce the original image. Our image compression/decompression suite outperformed the reference implementation <a href="results.png">across the board</a>.
			
			<h3>PPMtrans Image Rotator</h3>
			<p>Written in C. The image rotator, known as PPMtrans, can take in a PPM image and allow the user to rotate, flip, or transpose the provided image. The abstract purpose of this project was to teach students about locality, so the PPMtrans program also allows the user to specify whether pixels are traversed in row-major, col-major, or block-major order when the rotation process is being carried out.</p>		
		

			<h3>Universal Machine and Related Projects</h3>
			<p>Written in C. The universal machine was easily my favorite project from this course. The machine consists of 32-bit registers and an address space utilizing 32-bit addresses, and utilizes 14 word-oriented instructions. The original version of the Universal Machine ran 50 million instructions in 4.7 seconds.	In a related project on speed profiling, the UM was modified such that processes took just 20% of their original computation time to complete execution.  In addition, a Macro Assembler was written for the UM, adding several instructions for those wishing to program in the UM Assembly Language, and with this tool a Reverse Polish Notation calculator was written for the Universal Machine.</p>
