			<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
	       
            <p>In the Fall 2013 semester, I took COMP-105: Programming Languages with Samuel Guyer. Projects in this class were written in a variety of languages.</p>	
			
        <h3>ImpCore</h3>
        <p>The first assignments for 105 dealt with a language called ImpCore (Imperative Core), meant to demonstrate the basic features of an imperative language. I implemented several basic functions in the language, and in addition, added support for local variables in the C interpreter for the language.</p>

        <h3>microScheme</h3>
        <p>The assignment in microScheme (a language developed to capture the most important features of Scheme) included writing the following functions in the language: map, fold, filter, take, drop, zip, and unzip.</p>

        <h3>ML</h3>
        <p>The first ML assignment involved implementing functions like foldl, foldr, zip, unzip, and flatten. In addtion, I implemented environments (mappings of names to values) two different ways; the first using lists, and the second using functions. Sequences with constant-time append, and finger-lists (with constant-time insertion deletion at the finger) were also implemented.</p>

        <h3>Type Checkers</h3>
        <p>The most substantial project for this class involved implementing
        the Type Checkers (in ML) for both typed ImpCore and typed microScheme (versions of ImpCore and microScheme with explicit types), demonstrating knowledge of the connection between type rules, representation of types, and the ML code that made up the interpreters.</p>
