        <p>I'm Rob, nice to meet you!</p>

          For the last five years I've worked at
          <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> on our news products in
          Search. Most recently, my work has been centered around surfacing news
          related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

          I received my B.S. in Computer Science from
          <a href="https://cs.tufts.edu">Tufts</a>, where I graduated Summa Cum
          Laude, and grew up on Long Island, NY.

          I love music, skewing towards rock and metal; according to Spotify
          my favorite genre in 2020 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent">djent</a>,
          and my favorite bands are
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11FY888Qctoy6YueCpFkXT">Circa Survive</a>,
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3utxjLheHaVEd9bPjQRsy8">Coheed and Cambria</a>, and
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7nCgNmfYJcsVy3vOOzExYS">The Contortionist</a>.
          In college, I started collecting records; I've got around 100 in my collection now. I've been
          playing the bass for longer than I can remember, and I'm doubling down on improving (and
          learning guitar!) while we're all stuck at home.

          I'm also doing a healthy amount of gaming these days. Currently, it's a mix
          of <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/demons-souls/">Demon's Souls</a>,
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">Among Us</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding/">Death Stranding</a>.

          My partner Martha and I live together in Brooklyn, and I'm
          in the midst of convincing her that getting a dog is a great idea. üê∂
