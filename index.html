        <h1>Oh, Hello! üëã</h1>
        <p>I'm Rob, nice to meet you.</p>
        <p>
          For the last six years I've worked at
          <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> on our news products in
          Search. My current focus is on improved query understanding. 
          You can find <a href="resume.html">my resume here</a>.

          I'm a proud member of <a href="https://www.alphabetworkersunion.org">
          Alphabet Workers Union (AWU-CWA)</a>, where I currently serve as the
          chapter coordinator for New York City. I'm also a member of 
          <a href="https://www.socialists.nyc">NYC-DSA</a>. I believe these
          are two important vehicles for leaving our workplaces, society, and
          world a little bit better off than we've found them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science
          from <a href="https://cs.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a> in
          Somerville, MA. Before that, I grew up on Long Island, NY, where
          I attended public school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music is my main extracurricular obsession. Circa Survive, Coheed and Cambria,
          and The Contortionist are a few of my favorite bands; according to Spotify
          my favorite genre in 2020 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent">djent</a>.
          I started collecting records in college and have somewhere around 100 in my collection
          now. My current musical focus is improving as a guitarist, but I also grew up playing 
          bass guitar, and on occasion mess around with Ableton Live.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to game, but don't find the time to do it consistently. Currently, I'm
          playing a mix of Chrono Trigger, Halo, and Returnal. My biggest gaming achievements
          are probably beating Bloodborne and Demon's Souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in New York City with my partner, and hope to add a puppy into the mix
          whenever we have a bit more space. üê∂
