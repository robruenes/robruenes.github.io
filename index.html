        <h1>Oh, Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>I'm Rob, nice to meet you!</p>
        <p>
          I currently reside in Brooklyn's Park Slope with my partner, Martha.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised on Long Island, and then spent four really great
          years at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a> in
          Medford, MA. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer
          Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've been employed by this website called
          <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, working with a bunch of
          freaky-smart folks on our News products in Search.
        </p>

          You can find an online version of
          <a href="resume.html">my resume here</a>.

        <p>
          Outside of work, my biggest interests are music, politics, and gaming.
          I'm a metalhead and record collector (nearing 100!), I volunteer for
          <a href="https://www.berniesanders.com"
            >Bernie Sanders' 2020 Presidential Campaign</a
          >, and lately, the first thing I do in the morning is find my Switch
          and start up
          <a href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/"
            >Animal Crossing</a
          >.
