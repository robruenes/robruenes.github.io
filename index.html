          For the last five years I've worked at
          <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> on our news products in
          Search. Most recently, my work has been centered around surfacing news
          related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

          I'm a member of the
          <a href="https://socialists.nyc">NYC DSA chapter</a>, because I
          believe that democratic socialism is the best vehicle for creating a
          society that is more just, fair, and kind. Prior to this, I was a
          victory captain on
          <a href="https://www.berniesanders.com"
            >Bernie's 2020 presidential campaign</a
          >.

          I received my B.S. in Computer Science from
          <a href="https://cs.tufts.edu">Tufts</a>, where I graduated Summa Cum
          Laude, and grew up on Long Island, NY.

          <a href="https://www.circasurvive.com">Circa Survive</a> and
          <a href="https://www.coheedandcambria.com">Coheed</a>, and I have
          around one hundred records in my personal collection.
