          For the last five years I've worked at
          <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> on our news products in
          Search. Most recently, my work has been centered around surfacing news
          related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

          I'm a member of the
          <a href="https://socialists.nyc">NYC DSA chapter</a>, because I
          believe that democratic socialism is the best vehicle for creating a
          society that is more just, fair, and kind. Prior to this, I was a
          victory captain on
          <a href="https://www.berniesanders.com"
            >Bernie's 2020 presidential campaign</a
          >.

          I received my B.S. in Computer Science from
          <a href="https://cs.tufts.edu">Tufts</a>, where I graduated Summa Cum
          Laude, and grew up on Long Island, NY.

          I'm really into music, with a bit of a skew towards rock and metal.
          My favorite bands are
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11FY888Qctoy6YueCpFkXT">Circa Survive</a>,
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3utxjLheHaVEd9bPjQRsy8">Coheed and Cambria</a>, and
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7nCgNmfYJcsVy3vOOzExYS">The Contortionist</a>.
          In college, I started collecting records; I've got around 100 in my collection now. I've been
          playing the bass for over a decade, and I'm learning the guitar now, too.
        </p>

          Recently, I've gotten back into gaming. These days, I'm playing a mix of
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/374320/">Dark Souls 3</a>,
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">Among Us</a>, and
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39210/">Final Fantasy XIV</a>.

          My partner Martha and I live together in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and I'm
          in the midst of convincing her that getting a dog is a great idea. üê∂
