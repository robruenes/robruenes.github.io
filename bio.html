    <h1>Personal Bio</h1>
    <p>My name is Robert Ruenes, and I'm a senior at Tufts University graduating with a degree in Computer Science. 
    <br>I am currently searching for full-time employment in the New York City area.</p>

    <p>I grew up on Long Island in the state of New York. In high school, I largely focused my studies in natural science courses. 
    <br>I was an active member of my high school's Wind Ensemble and Jazz Ensemble, and was an athlete on the school's varsity fencing team; today, I'm the captain of the team here at Tufts.</p>

    <p>Like many others I arrived at college expecting myself to graduate with 
        a degree in biology or chemistry and then head to medical school. 
        <br>However, after taking Remco Chang's Introduction to Computer Science
        course here at Tufts, I quickly jumped ships and haven't looked back since.
    </p>

    <p>Since that class back in my freshman year, I've had a number of very enjoyable internships, working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Galatea Associates, LLC. 
    <br>I am currently in my last semester at Tufts, and am taking courses in Web Programming, Operating Systems, and Concurrent Programming.</p>
